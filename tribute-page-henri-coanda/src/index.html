      <h3> Henri Coanda's major achievements </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1886</strong> Henri Coanda was born in Bucharest on the 7th of June and was the second child of a numerous family. His father had been General Constantin Coanda, a former Maths teacher of National School of Roads and Bridges in Bucharest and was Prime Minister of Romania for a short time in 1918. His mother, Aida Danet, was the daughter of French doctor Gustave Danet, born in Brittany.

Since childhood, the future engineer and physicist had been fascinated by wind miracle, fact that he would remember later. Henri Coanda was firstly a student of Petrache Poenaru School in Bucharest, then of St. Sava High School, where he attended the first three grades.</li>

        <li><strong>1899</strong> Being 13 years old, he was sent by his father (who wanted to guide him to a military career) to Military High School in Iasi.</li>

        <li><strong>1903</strong> He graduated high school getting the rank of Major Sergeant and continued his studies within School of Gunners, Engineering and Navy in Bucharest.</li>

        <li><strong>1904</strong> Detached to a field artillery regiment in Germany, he was sent to Technische Hochschule (Technical University) in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He was keen on technical issues and especially on aviation engineering.</li>


        <li><strong>1905</strong> Coanda built a rocket aircraft for Romanian army.</li>

        <li><strong>1907-1908</strong> He also attended academic courses in Belgium, at Liege and to Montefiore Technical Institute.</li>

        <li><strong>1908</strong> He returned to Romania and was an active officer in Regiment II of Artillery. Because of his temper and ingenuity that did not deal with military discipline, he asked and got the approval to leave the army and then, taking advantage of regained freedom, he made a long trip by car to Isfahan-Tehran-Tibet.</li>

        <li><strong>1909</strong> Coming back he went to France and enrolled to Superior School of Aerospace and Construction, newly established to Paris and graduated it in 1910 as valedictorian of the first class of aeronautical engineers.


Helped by engineer Gustave Eiffel and scientist Paul Painleve, who supported him to obtain necessary approvals, Henri Coanda made prior aerodynamic experiments and founded in Joachim Caproni’s camber workshop the first reactive propulsion aircraft, in fact a jet plane, without propeller, conventionally called „Coanda-1910” and which was presented to the second Aeronautic International Salon in Paris, 1910.</li>

        <li><strong>1910</strong> During a fly attempt on December, on Issy-les-Moulineaus airport, near Paris, the machine piloted by Henri Coanda got out of control because of his lack of experience, hit a wall on the wing for takeoff and caught on fire. Fortunately, Coanda was thrown out of the plane before impact and was just scared and a little hurt on the face and hands. For a while, Coanda stopped the experiments because of audience and scientists’ lack of interest at that time.</li>

        <li><strong>1911-1914</strong> Henri Coanda worked as Technical Director of Aircraft Factories in Bristol, England, and built many high performance propeller planes, according to his own conception.

In Reims, Henri Coanda presented a fly machine with two coupled engines that operated with only one propeller.

As Technical Director of Aircrafts Factories in Bristol, he designed many “classical” (with propeller) aircrafts known as Bristol-Coanda. In 1912 one of them won the first prize to International Contest of Military Aviation in England.</li>

        <li><strong>1914-1918</strong> Henri Coanda worked for “Saint-Chamond” and “SIA-Delaunay-Belleville” in Saint Denis. During this time he designed three types of aircrafts, of which „Coanda-1916” is the most known, having two propellers close to tail plane. „Coanda-1916” looks like Caravelle transport plane, to which projection he also participated.</li>

        <li><strong>1916</strong> He returned to France and built a much appreciated pathfinder, the first sled car powered by a jet engine, the first aerodynamic train in the world and many other things.</li>

        <li><strong>1926</strong> In Romania, Henri Coanda put-to-point a detection device of liquids in soil. It is used for petroliferous prospecting.

          Romanian inventor built on Persian Gulf, an underwater concrete tank for oil storage.</li>

        <li><strong>1934</strong> He got a French invention patent for the Procedure and device used for a fluid stream diverting  that enters into another fluid, which is related to phenomenon called “Coanda Effect” nowadays and consists of diverting of a fluid jet that flows along a convex wall, phenomenon that was noticed first time by him in 1910 when his jet airplane’ engine’s probing. This discovery led him to important applicative researches concerned to hyper sustentation of aerodynes and to some sound attenuators development.</li>

        <li><strong>1969</strong> Henri Coanda finally returned to the country as Director of Technical and Scientific Creation Institute (INCREST).</li>
        <li><strong>1972</strong> Henri Coanda died in Bucharest on the 25th of November when he was 86 years old.</li>
